Welcome! This is an open-source project to support community organizations everywhere.

This project creates a platform of digital tools that are useful for a neighborhood, or a community of people who live close to one another. The old saying "it takes a village" is as true today as ever before. But unfortunately many people don't know or support their neighbors. We hope to change that.

Every neighborhood can clone this project and host their own 'community platform'. We provide easy step-by-step instructions so that even without any coding experience you can easily set up your own local server. All you need is an extra computer connected to the internet!

setup.md - For setting up the project on your personal computer
deploy.md - For deploying a local server on your 'extra' computer


Here is a list of current features of the platform

- Request help for a project
- Request help with an errand
- Borrow a tool
- Request a meal


- Loan a tool
- Provide a meal
- Browse requests from neighbors
